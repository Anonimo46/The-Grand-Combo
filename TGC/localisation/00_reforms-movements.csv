It is our duty to bring Western civilization to backward peoples across the world.

eight_hours_desc;Working hours legislation aims to not only reduce the workload, but it also gives the right to a minimum number of holidays each year, restricts excessive night work and establishes the right to vacations, all this without a reduction of the workers’ salaries. While wages grow and working hours decline, the people have more time for leisure and for consuming, driving demand up. At eight hours per day, almost all workers have the right to weekends off and annual vacations. Free time for leisure is at an all-time high and the entertainment industry is in the middle of a boom. All over our country resorts emerge thanks to cheap hotels and inexpensive railway fares, widespread banking holidays and we watch the fading of many religious prohibitions against secular activities on Sundays.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

exploitation;Indirect Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
exploitation_desc;Indirect Rule is a system of government of one nation by another in which the governed people retain certain administrative, legal, and other powers. Colonial rule was maintained through pre-existing local power structures. These dependencies were often called ‘protectorates’ or ‘trucial states’. By this system, the day-to-day government and administration of areas both small and large was left in the hands of traditional rulers, who gained prestige and the stability and protection afforded by the Colonial overlord.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

jefferson_method_desc;The Jefferson Method is a highest averages method for allocating seats, and is thus a type of party-list proportional representation. Proportional representation systems aim to allocate seats to parties approximately in proportion to the number of votes received. For example, if a party wins one-third of the votes, then it should gain about one-third of the seats. In general, exact proportionality is not possible because these divisions produce fractional numbers of seats. As a result, several methods have been devised which ensure that the parties’ seat allocations, which are of course whole numbers, are as proportional as possible. In comparison with the Sainte-Lague method, §Ythe Jefferson Method slightly favours large parties and coalitions over scattered small parties§W.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

totalitarianism;Totalitarianism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
totalitarianism_desc;The suppression of the basic institutions and rights of a democratic society became one of the first goals of Fascist and Communist states. Parliaments were abolished or made rubber stamps for state decrees and programs. Elections and Plebiscites (if held at all) were no longer secret-ballot: any citizens who opposed were virtually forced to vote the party line, or face punishment in prison or even in Gulags/Concentration Camps. The Press was censored, or more often became another state organ for the dissemination of propaganda extolling the regime’s virtues and demonizing its enemies. Freedom of expression in academia, in the world of culture and in the public sphere was curtailed. Professors, scientists and professionals were willingly or unwillingly conscripted to serve the state’s priorities. Many intellectuals became emigres and moved to other democratic nations, because to stay and refuse to serve meant incarceration or death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
