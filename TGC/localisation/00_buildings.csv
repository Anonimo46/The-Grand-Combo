aeroplane_factory;Aeroplane Factory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aeroplane_factory_desc;Most aircraft in the era are constructed from wood, using metal sockets to joint members, and making use of piano wire or stranded steel cable for bracing. Wooden construction typically involved several different types of timber, with careful use of different woods according to their mechanical properties and they were typically covered in a variety of fabrics including rubberized cotton and varnished silk. The first engine design to be widely used for powering aircraft was the Antoinette water-cooled V-8 engine, believed to be the very first V-form eight-cylinder internal combustion engine ever placed in production.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ammunition_factory;Ammunition Factory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ammunition_factory_desc;Swaging, rather than casting, was the preferred manufacturing technique during the 19th century for ammunition. Swaged bullets are bullets manufactured by swaging room temperature metals into a die to form it into the shape of a bullet. The other common manufacturing method is casting, which uses molten metals poured into a mould. Disadvantages became evident as loadings shifted to smokeless powder in the late 19th century and manufacturers of high-velocity military ammunition modified their bullet swaging process to apply a thin sheet of stronger metal over the soft lead bullet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

artillery_factory;Artillery Factory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
artillery_factory_desc;The first stage of artillery production is to create an exact model of the gun, mortar, or howitzer. This is built up upon a tapered wooden spindle, from eight to 12 feet in length and about two inches less than the model in diameter. The spindle is then set upon a wooden turning frame and covered with grease or soap to aid in its eventual removal from the mould. A coat of a lye mixture is spread over the interior surface to prevent the molten metal of the casting adhering to the walls of the mould. The mould is then taken to the casting pit to be annealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

automobile_factory_desc;Early automobiles, known as ‘Horseless Carriages’, were simple vehicles with two or four stroke combustion engines capable of 2/3 horsepower (0.50 kW) at 250 rpm. Featuring an open crankcase and the use of a pushrod-operated poppet valve for exhaust, a large horizontal flywheel that stabilized the single-cylinder engine’s power output and an evaporative carburettor controlled by a sleeve valve to regulate power and engine speed. They were produced in small workshops but evolved fast, with the simple open metal frame soon giving way to chassis with glass windows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
barrel_factory;Tank Factory;Usine de chars;Geschützrohrfabrik;;;;;;;;;;;x
barrel_factory_desc;The tank is the 20th century realization of an ancient concept: that of providing troops with mobile protection and firepower and it was born of the need to break the domination of trenches, barbed wire, and machine guns over the battlefields. The internal combustion engine, armour plate, and the continuous track were key innovations leading to the invention of the modern tank. One of the earliest used designs was a rhomboid vehicle with a low canter of gravity and long track length, able to negotiate broken ground and cross trenches while the main armament was carried in sponsons on the hull sides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
canned_food_factory;Cannery;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
canned_food_factory_desc;The canning concept is based on experimental food preservation work in glass containers by the French inventor Nicolas Appert. The fabrication of most cans results in at least one ‘rim’, a narrow ring whose outside diameter is slightly larger than that of the rest of the can. The flat surfaces of rimmed cans are recessed from the edge of any rim (toward the middle of the can) by about the width of the rim: the inside diameter of a rim, adjacent to this recessed surface, is slightly smaller than the inside diameter of the rest of the can. Canned food is mainly used for military rations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cement_factory;Cement Plant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cement_factory_desc;In 1824 Joseph Aspdin, a British bricklayer turned builder, patented a chemical process for making Portland cement which was an important advance in the building trades. This process involves sintering a mixture of clay and limestone to about 1400 °C (2552 °F), then grinding it into a fine powder which is then mixed with water, sand, and gravel to produce concrete. Concrete is used to build factories, forts, shipyards, buildings, sewage systems and tunnels. Its use quickly became widespread in civil and military construction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

clipper_shipyard;Clipper Shipyard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
clipper_shipyard_desc;Clippers are fast vessels with three masts and a square rig. They are generally narrow for their length, can carry limited bulk freight and have a large total sail area. Optimized for speed, they are too fine-lined to carry much cargo. Clippers typically carry extra sails such as skysails and moonrakers on the masts and studdingsails on booms extending out from the hull or yards, which required extra hands to handle them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dye_factory;Dyeworks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dye_factory_desc;Natural dye is only present in small amounts and its extraction is often inefficient, so they are usually expensive. In an experiment with a compound called aniline, one of the simplest chemical components of coal tar, one inventor discovered that an alcohol extracted purple colour, which readily dyed silk, and was much more stable in sunlight than any other purple dye in use. In the Synthetic Dyeworks dyes are mixed, synthesized in a reactor, filtered for impurities, dried out and then blended. Along the way many other additives, solvents and chemical compounds are used to instigate reactions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
electric_gear_factory;Electric Gear Factory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
electric_gear_factory_desc;The age of electricity began in 1882 when Thomas A. Edison introduced a system of electric lighting in New York City. Electric lighting quickly spread across the United States and was soon adopted in Europe. The electrical components industry was born, producing a variety of electric components for cars, telephones, gramophones, and industrial machinery in general as the electrification in the industry advanced. Electric gears are needed for a variety of things, among them automobiles, telephones, radios, and aeroplanes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
explosives_factory;Explosives Factory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
explosives_factory_desc;The explosives factory manufactures a variety of components for industrial and military use like nitroglycerin, dynamite and black powder. In the early 19th century black power was the main fabricated component, used to mine for minerals, break rocks, clear fields, and make roads. With the invention of dynamite, mines could be dug deeper and more quickly, and uneconomical deposits thus became profitable. Still, the main use of explosives was in the military industry: bombs, gunpowder, ordnances. For infantry, artillery or sappers, the use of explosives and gunpowder was central in the army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fabric_factory;Textile Mill;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fabric_factory_desc;Fabric is a tightly woven textile made in a textile mill which is, among other things, used to produce sails for ships as well as clothing. With the Cartwright Loom, the Spinning Mule and the Boulton & Watt steam engine, the pieces were in place to build a mechanized textile industry. From this point there were no new inventions, but a continuous improvement in technology as the mill-owner strove to reduce cost and improve quality. Developments in the transport infrastructure facilitated the import of raw materials and export of finished cloth, diminishing costs and increasing profits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

fertilizer_factory;Fertiliser Plant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fertilizer_factory_desc;In this factory fertiliser is created out of guano, sulphur, or bone meal. The most common way to create fertiliser is the Birkeland-Eyde process. This process was used to fix atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into nitric acid (HNO3), one of several chemical processes generally referred to as nitrogen fixation. The resultant nitric acid was then used as a source of nitrate (NO3-) for the fertilisers. These fertilisers are used to increase the productivity of farms or the chemical components are further refined to make explosives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

furniture_factory_desc;Well-off pops live in very comfortable houses, although their servants lived in cramped quarters, often in the attic. During the 19th century, for the first time in history furniture was mass-produced. That meant it was cheaper but unfortunately standards of design fell. In the early 19th century skilled workers usually lived in ‘through houses’ i.e. ones that were not joined to the backs of other houses while the general populace often lived in ‘back-to-backs’. These were houses of three (or sometimes only two) rooms, one of top of the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
glass_factory;Glass Factory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
glass_factory_desc;A new method of producing glass, known as the cylinder process, was developed in Europe during the early 19th century. In 1832, this process was used by the Chance Brothers to create sheet glass. This advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created without interruption, thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings. The other glass-making method is glassblowing which produces bottles and other containers. Glass is used for a variety of appliances like bottles, windows, bowls, vases, lamps, jars, vacuum tubes, and light bulbs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Since the motive power of screw propulsion is delivered along the shaft, a thrust bearing is needed to transfer that load without excessive friction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
steel_factory;Steel Mill;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
steel_factory_desc;Steel is an alloy of iron and other elements, primarily carbon, used in construction and other applications. When iron is smelted from its ore it contains more carbon than is desirable. To become steel, it must be reprocessed to reduce the carbon to the correct amount, at which point other elements can be added. Steel mills cast the raw iron into ingots which are stored until further refinement processes. The steel ingots are then heated in a soaking pit and hot rolled into slabs, blooms, or billets. Those are rolled into sheet metal, plates, bars, rods, wires, and structural steel, such as I-beams and rails.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sugar_beet_refinery;Sugar Beet Refinery;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sugar_beet_refinery_desc;Modern sugar beets date back to mid-18th century Silesia where the king of Prussia subsidised experiments aimed at processes for sugar extraction. He also demonstrated that the sugar that could be extracted from beets was identical to that produced from cane. His student, Franz Karl Achard, evaluated 23 varieties of mangelwurzel for sugar content and selected a local strain from Halberstadt in modern-day Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Moritz Baron von Koppy and his son further selected from this strain for white, conical tubers.  The selection was named weiße schlesische Zuckerrübe, meaning white Silesian sugar beet, and is the progenitor of all modern sugar beets. A royal decree led to the first factory devoted to sugar extraction from beetroots being opened in Kunern, Silesia  in 1801. The Silesian sugar beet was soon introduced to France, where Napoleon opened schools specifically for studying the plant. He also ordered that 28,000 hectares (69,000 acres) be devoted to growing the new sugar beet, in response to British blockades of cane sugar during the Napoleonic Wars, which ultimately stimulated the rapid growth of a European sugar beet industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
synthetic_oil_factory;Coal Liquefaction Plant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
synthetic_oil_factory_desc;The main methods of direct conversion of coal to liquids by hydrogenation process is the Bergius process. In this process, the coal is finely ground and dried in a stream of hot gas. The dry product is mixed with heavy oil recycled from the process and a catalyst is typically added to the mixture. Usually, iron sulphides present in the coal may have sufficient catalytic activity for the process. The mixture is then pumped into a reactor and the reaction occurs between 400 to 500 °C and 20 to 70 MPa hydrogen pressure. The reaction produces heavy oils, middle oils, gasoline, and gases.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

wool_mill;Woolen Fabric Factory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wool_mill_desc;Wool comes from domesticated sheep and other animals, including cashmere and mohair from goats, qiviut from muskoxen, hide and fur clothing from bison, angora from rabbits, and other types of wool from camelids. It forms two products, woolens and worsteds. The sheep has two sorts of wool and it is the inner coat that is used. This can be mixed with wool that has been recovered from rags. Shoddy is the term for recovered wool that is not matted, while mungo comes from felted wool. Extract is recovered chemically from mixed cotton/wool fabrics. The fleece is cut in one piece from the sheep. This is then skirted to remove the soiled wool, and baled. At the mill the wool is scoured in a detergent to remove grease (the yolk) and impurities. This is done mechanically in the opening machine. Vegetable matter can be removed chemically using sulphuric acid (carbonising). Washing uses a solution of soap and sodium carbonate. The wool is oiled before carding or combing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
